# This strategy allows us to trade in any market conditions. It uses EMAGAIN
# to pick pairs at the bottom of their trade cycle. It uses RSI to confirm
# we are at the bottom of the trade cycle to ensure we buy the dip. Finally
# it trails the price to ensure we get the best buy. It may not buy during
# Bitcoin mooning but there should be suffient pairs in your DCA log to allow
# you to trade through those times.
#
# This strategy is good for both Bear, Bull or sideways markets where
# volatility is at its lowest.
